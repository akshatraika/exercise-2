# X-Team 15 Style Guide
We will use the CS300 course style guide (Gary's style guide) because we believe it is straightforward and will be valuable to allow us to have uniform code and to communicate the functionality with each other.  http://cs300-www.cs.wisc.edu/wp/index.php/2017/08/15/cs300-java-style-guide/

## Naming conventions
Same as class guide.
example:
functionName and ClassName
### Examples
* interfaces -- UpperCamelCase
* classes -- UpperCamelCase
* exception types -- UpperCamelCaseException
* fields -- lowerCamelCase
* methods   -- lowerCamelCase
* parameters   -- lowerCamelCase
* local variables  -- lowerCamelCase
* instance constants  -- All caps ---- VARIABLE_NAME
* class constants   --- All Caps: CONSTANT_NAME

## Commenting style for public and private members of a class or interface:

commenting would also be same as cs300 style guide. 

### Examples

* classes   -- class introduction comment
* fields   -- short explaination
* constructors  
* methods
* coding style (brackets, horizontal, and vertical spacing) for:
  * if statements
  * switch statement
  * while loops
  * for loops
  * enhanced for loops
