# X-Team 15 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
The leader will asssign tasks based on group members' abilities and strengths. If a group member is unable to fulfill this task, 
the leader will allow that member to switch tasks with someone else. 


## How we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will track progress through daily check-ins over text message and slack. The leader will make sure everyone is up to pace on 
their assigned tasks. If communication is needed more frequently, we will follow-up as needed. 


## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
If we run into challenges, we will first try to describe and resolve the difficulties over text message or slack. If it cannot be resolved over task, the leader or another member will meet with those having difficulties at our assigned meeting place to work through the issue.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will check in with each other, as stated before, every day as a deadline is approaching. If a member has a conflict or is worried about meeting the deadline, other members may step in to offer help as needed. We will hold each other accountable to stay on track before the deadline to avoid last minute conflicts.
